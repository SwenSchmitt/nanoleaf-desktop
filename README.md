Looking for a desktop alternative to the Nanoleaf mobile app? Look no further. Now you can control your devices from your computer on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Installation
No installation necessary! Simply download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/rowak/nanoleaf-desktop/releases) and run the .jar file. If you are on Windows or Mac, you can also download their platform-specific executable files. **This application requires Java, so make sure that you have at least java 8 installed.**

## Features
- Select regular and rhythm scenes, set solid colors, and modify the brightness and color temperature

- Discover new scenes and plugins created by other Nanoleaf users
- Control devices from a computer outside your local network
- Ambient lighting with two modes, customizable capture zones, and multi-monitor support
- Custom dark modern UI

## Limitations
- The live preview does not currently support "dynamic" effects
- Ambient lighting may not support all secondary monitors (primary monitor support is guarenteed)
